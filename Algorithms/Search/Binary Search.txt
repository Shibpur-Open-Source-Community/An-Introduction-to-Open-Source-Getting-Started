You have been given an array A consisting of N integers. All the elements in this array A are unique. You have to answer some queries based on the elements of this array. Each query will consist of a single integer x. You need to print the rank based position of this element in this array considering that the array is 1 indexed. The rank based position of an element in an array is its position in the array when the array has been sorted in ascending order.

Note: It is guaranteed that all the elements in this array are unique and for each x belonging to a query, value ′x′ shall exist in the array

Input Format

The first line consists of a single integer N denoting the size of array A. The next line contains N unique integers, denoting the content of array A. The next line contains a single integer q denoting the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains a single integer x denoting the element whose rank based position needs to be printed.

Output Format

You need to print q integers denoting the answer to each query.

Constraints

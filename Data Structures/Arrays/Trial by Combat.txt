After Joeffrey chocked to death, Cercei blamed Tyrian for his death. After seeing his love, Shae betrayed him, he demanded trial by combat. Now this combat is not with swords but with logic and problem solving. Tywin will ask Tyrian questions and he have to answer them correctly.
Tywin asks him this question:
There are n lannisters, out of which some are sitting and some are standing. After one hour, some of them will sit according to this rule:
Only those lannisters will sit who had both their neighbors sitting the previous hour. For more clarity refer to sample test case. Now, Tywin asks Tyrian to tell who all are standing and who all are sitting after m hours.
Note: For lannisters on corners there is only 1 neighbor.

[Input]
First line contains an integer t denoting no.of test cases.
Second line contains two integers n,m denoting number of lannisters and no.of hours respectively.
Third line contains n space separated integers either 0 or 1 depending on whether lannister is standing or sitting respectively

[Output]
For each test case output n space separated integers according to the ques. For more clarity see sample test case. 

[Constraints]
1<=t<=1000
2<=n<=100
0<=m<=10000
